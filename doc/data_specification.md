# JSON Specification

All party data is JSON encoded (for ease of use). Each party object is located in it's own file (for ease of use).

## Basic concepts

### Party object

Party data is wrapped in a single object with the following properties:

**Party Code** 

Used as unique identifier.

Unless standard international identifier already exists (i.e. PPUK instead PPGB), Party code should follow the standard format:

National parties:

`PP<nationalISOCode>`

SubParties:

`PP<nationalISOCode>-<subpartyCode>`

Youth Wings:

`YP<nationalISOCode>`

Note: The data format is mostly self explanitory, but documentation will be provided in time.

```
"partyCode": "PPSI"
```

**Country Code**

Used to define country of origin. Presumes only one party per country.

Identified with two char [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code. 

```
"countryCode": "si"
```

**Country Name** 

Used to define country of origin. Full english name of country.
Why? Because lazy & better readability.

```
"country": "Slovenia",
```

**Party Name** 

Used to define name of the party in english and original language(s). Supports any number of translations (for multi-lingual countries), but english is required.

Key is two char [ISO language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
```
"partyName": {
        "en": "Pirate Party Slovenia",
        "sl": "Piratska stranka Slovenije"
    },
```

**Party Type** 

Used to differentiate between national, regional, local, and youth parties.

Allowed values:
* national

* local
* youth

This dataset should not be used to log international organisations. 

```
"type": "national",
```

**Region**

*For parties of _type_ REGIONAL only!*

Upper/Lower case, spaces etc. will be preserved. Use english names.

```
"region": "Bavaria",
```

**Parent organisation** 

Required if Party Type is other than "national". Value must be Party Code of parent organisation.

```
"parentorganisation": "PPSI",
```

Subkeys:

Coordiantes (optional) - with demical degrees.

Value type differs between social networks and MUST be uniform across the dataset.
